# PMM-Reports
Three add-on reports for the Salesforce.org Program Management Module (PMM). These reports are designed to help front-line staff (case managers, program managers, etc.)  track their service deliveries with clients.
1. <b>My Service Deliveries Last Month</b>. This report provides front-line staff with a list of services they delivered to clients sorted by date. This can help with time tracking or workload management. Report notes:
<ul>
<li>As configured, this only shows service deliveries from last month.</li>
<li>The running user of the report is the owner of the service delivery records as this report only shows “My Service Deliveries”</li>
<li>The timeframe for the report can be changed via a filter</li>
  </ul>

2. <b>My Services by Client Last Month</b>. This report lets front-line staff see what services they have delivered to clients, grouped by client. Report notes:
<ul>
<li>As configured, this only shows service deliveries from last month.</li>
<li>The running user of the report is the owner of the service delivery records as this report only shows “My Service Deliveries”</li>
<li>The timeframe for the report can be changed via a filter</li>
  </ul>

3. <b>My Service Deliveries by Program/Client</b>. This report can help front-line staff see what services they have delivered, grouped by program and client in this month and last month. Report notes:
<ul>
<li>As configured, this only shows service deliveries from this month and last month.</li>
<li>The running user of the report is the owner of the service delivery records as this report only shows “My Service Deliveries”</li>
<li>The timeframe for the report can be changed via a filter</li>
  </ul>
